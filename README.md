A very simple way to get data from the meetup api and convert to CSV format.

Optionally, you can load into Google BigQuery and use a visualization tools such as redash.io (requires a Google Account and a BigQuery project).   For examples of this, see https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/personal-real-estate:gdg.meetup and http://demo.redash.io/queries/156/source#199 (requires Google Account and BigQuery project)
